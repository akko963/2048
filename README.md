## 2048-final
   This file uses python 3.5. requires pygame and some other common libraries. All the font and sound files required are included. Only tested on windows 7.

## 2048-py2
   This file is converted using 3to2. I don't have python 2 installed on system so I am unable to test it. Let me know if it runs correctly. Please feel free to submit patches.

## Thanks to r/pygame for all the great helps.
